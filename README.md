# Abbott-Smith's "Manual Lexicon of the Greek New Testament" Online
A little JS app to make Abbott-Smith searchable and usable with a focus on good UI and UX.

# To Do List
- [ ] Refactor the code to search via JS data structure rather than raw XML
- [ ] Implement searching by Strongs #
- [ ] Fix the ref tagger to tag _all_ references (using 'osisref' element in XML)
- [ ] Replace BLB ref tagger with a simpler/cleaner approach. Maybe use [SBL GNT]([url](https://github.com/LogosBible/SBLGNT/tree/master/data/sblgnt/xml))? See also Bible API [1]([url](https://bible.helloao.org/docs/guide/making-requests.html)) and [2]([url](https://fetch.bible/access/client/))
- [ ] Make the "NT Usage #" link to a search for the lemma in STEPBible
- [ ] Expand all abbreviations or at least make tooltips (with HTML abbr tag) 
- [ ] Full offline functionality with service workers
- [ ] Show recently searched words so user can easily go back to them
- [ ] Add some relevant info to the page for SEO purposes and check how it shows up in search engines
- [ ] Surface the front-matter/introductory material for the lexicon
- [ ] Add a keyboad legend for converting Greek to Latin letters
- [ ] Make final sigma and e/Î· more compatible for latinized searches
- [ ] Use an HTML element other than 'title' for storing the Strongs #
- [ ] Clean up and consolidate CSS
